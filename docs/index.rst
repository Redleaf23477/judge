Judge - HypeX documentation
=========================================

Judge - HypeX is a judge system which focuses on performance and security.

It requires root permission to run. The host must have the full ``Linux namespaces`` support and the ``memory cgroup``, also the ``access control lists(acl)`` needs to be enabled on the file system.


Requirements
------------

- python3 >= 3.6
- python3-pip
- gcc >= 7.4
- g++ >= 7.4
- clang >= 6.0
- cmake >= 2.8
- libcgroup-dev >= 0.41
- acl


Installation
------------

build-container.sh is used to copy files from the host to create the container. Currently, it is designed for ``Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64``. You may need to modify it to fit your host's file system. Or you can install it in the docker (see `Use Docker`_).

.. code::
   
   git clone https://github.com/pzread/judge.git
   cd judge
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   mkdir lib
   cd lib
   cmake ..
   make
   cd ..
   ./setup.sh


Usage
-----

.. code::
   
   cd judge
   sudo python3 Server.py
   

.. WARNING::
   
   Before delete the ``container`` directory, always remember to umount the ``udev file systems`` under it.


Run Tests
---------

.. code::

   cd judge
   sudo python3 -m tornado.test.runtests tests.TestDiff


.. _`Use Docker`: 

Use Docker
------------

.. WARNING::

   Make sure your docker supports ``access control lists(acl)``. For more information, see `How to use setfacl within a Docker container? <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22714885/how-to-use-setfacl-within-a-docker-container>`_.


There is a problem that acl isn't persistent on the docker's file system, so ``./setup.sh`` have to be run after starting a container.
   
For ``docker run``, you may need to expose ports to the host.


.. code::

   git clone https://github.com/pzread/judge.git
   cd judge
   docker build -t judge .
   docker run -p ${HOSTPORT}:2501 --privileged=true judge /bin/sh -c 'cd judge && ./setup.sh && python3 Server.py'
